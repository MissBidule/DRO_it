## DRO it

## Description
"DRO it" is an app to chat with friends only using drawings. It has been done with flutter as a Master school project to learn how to do a Mobile App. It is currently not available on any store and can be used only for testing purposes. 
__Do NOT__ use a real password if you ever get to use this app as it has been made to be as simple as possible and the passwords aren't hidden in the database. 

## Installation
Inside the submission folder is an APK file which can be simply download onto an Android Phone. Otherwise, retrieve the project and use "flutter run" on a simulator of your choice.

## Usage
Create an account / Log into one, and create conversations by clicking on the "+" blue button ! Draw, change your username and profile, and get creative !
For obvious reason we prohibit all NSFW drawings as there isn't any "moderation" system. If it appears there is some appearing, we'll block the user and delete all compromising drawings. Please bear with it.

## Support
Because the app is only a small project, no support system is available for now.

## Contributing
